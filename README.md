# i-Series Data Warehouse Toolkit

This repository provides an open-source foundation for building incremental, revision-aware ETL
pipelines that extract tables from IBM i (Db2 for i) systems into Parquet.

The project is under active scaffolding. Interfaces defined in `src/ibmi_etl/` document the expected
responsibilities for the core pipeline, credential handling, and linting components.

Refer to `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` for roadmap details and follow-on tasks.
